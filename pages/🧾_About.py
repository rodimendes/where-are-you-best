st.markdown("""OK. But what do temperature and humidity have to do with a tennis match?
All!
For amateur players the interference is little or not noticed. But when we talk about high-level or professional players, small variations in playing conditions are strongly noticed - have you noticed that the speed of the serve changes when done with new balls or, with each serve, we see a dance of the balls in the hands of the tennis players?
As well as the "age" of the balls, humidity and temperature alter the speed of the game, the behavior of the balls after the hits.
For example, with higher temperatures, balls tend to bounce more.
