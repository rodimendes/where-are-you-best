st.markdown("For this the python script gets data from the official webpage of female tennis players, that is, [Women's Tennis Association - WTA](https://www.wtatennis.com/) and gathers weather forecast data as temperature and humidity, collected by using API from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/).")
st.markdown("After collecting, cleaning and structuring the data as a dictionary, these are converted to a dataframe and stored in a relational database (MySQL).")
st.markdown("For display on this platform, we chose to use the data serialization technique, in pickle format, which allowed for greater speed in accessing and displaying data compared to performing queries in an RDBMS.")

st.markdown("Everything! üëÄ")
st.markdown("For amateur players the interference is little or not noticed. But when we talk about high-level or professional players, small variations in playing conditions have a greater impact on the athlete's performance - have you noticed that the speed of the serve changes when done with new balls or, with each serve, we see a dance of the balls in the hands of tennis players?")
st.markdown("As well as the ‚Äúage‚Äù of the balls, humidity and temperature alter the speed of the game, the behavior of the balls after hitting.")
st.markdown("For example, with higher temperatures, balls tend to bounce more. As well as humidity, if it is too high - greater than 80% - the ball becomes heavier, requiring more strength from the athlete and changing the tension of the racket strings.")
st.markdown("It is worth remembering that we are not even talking about the impact on the athlete's body, that is, the greater or lesser wear and tear depending on the temperature and humidity of the place where the match is played.")
