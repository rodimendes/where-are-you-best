# Where are U best?
### Project to find out where and under what weather conditions tennis players win.

## Description
`Where are U best` is a project that seeks to identify the degree of influence of the playing surface, temperature and humidity on female tennis players.

For this the python script gets data from the official webpage of female tennis players, that is, [Women's Tennis Association - WTA](https://www.wtatennis.com/) and gathers weather forecast data as temperature and humidity, collected by using API from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/).

On this first approach we've collected the following information:
- players,
- score,
- tournament,
- city,
- country,
- winner,
- score,
- date,
- temperature, and
- humidity
